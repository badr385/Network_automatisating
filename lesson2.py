#In previous course we learned how to set a variable, let's see now how to use it using numbers

#Let's run the code, u will get following results
# So we can add a comment in python, to make our codes more clear, sometimes u can use a code and forget how it s used with time, but by adding some cool comments, u can remember pretty fast
# u need to use this '#' before every line on ur code, also when setting a comment the python will not interpre it and u want have any error.
#last thing imagine u created a variable and don t wanna python interpre it, using the keyword '#'

#create ur variables, makes sure to not define as this number1 = "12" as python will think it s a string.
number1 = 12
number2 = 13

#Python operators to calculate

#Adding two number, addition operator in python is +

addition = number1 + number2

print(addition)

#soustraction of 2 numbers, soustraction operator is -

soustraction = number2 - number1

print(soustraction)
#Multiply of 2 number, multiply operator is *

multiply = number1 * number2
print(multiply)
#division of 2 number, divide operator is /

division = number1/number1
print(division)
#there's a lot of operator used to calculate in python u can find more here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html


#Let's run the code, u will get following results
#25
#1
#156
