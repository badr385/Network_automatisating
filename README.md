If u don t have python intalled in ur pc, and wanna test the codes to see output. Just relax, the following link is a web interpreter to execute the following codes. But for executing codes related to networks topics guys. We will really need u to install python on your pc in order to install many cool libraries that talented people created to help us execute our everyday life tasks.

I love to use replit, u can sign up and have a free usage, if u want more ressources u need to pay but it worth it. Also i use it to run some python discord bots and not the last, it permits u to keep ur code there.

If u wanna install python depending on ur os system here you will find all info in official python website :

Before u can be able to use python, in order to code some cool network topics related automatisation. As everything in life u need to learn the basics.
